The primary objective of this project is to create an accurate and reliable model that can identify 
individuals at risk of developing diabetes based on their clinical data. A diverse range of features, 
including glucose levels, blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), and age, will be utilized to train 
the predictive models. By analyzing these variables, the system aims to uncover patterns and 
relationships that can aid in the early detection of diabetes.

Overall, this project aims to leverage the power of machine learning to enhance diabetes detection 
and contribute to improved patient outcomes. By providing accurate predictions and valuable 
insights, this system has the potential to make a significant impact in the field of diabetes prevention, 
management, and public health
